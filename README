The project is aimed to port GNAT for MINDSTROMS NXT-Ravenscar edition to Raspberry Pi.
The port is done. Some examples based on Ravenscar profiles are provided and can be compiled and
 run on Pi smoothly. At present stage, only drivers for GPIO, mini_uart, sound playing by PWM and a
 system timer are finished, other drivers will come soon.
